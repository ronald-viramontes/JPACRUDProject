# JPACRUDProject
  The JPACRUDProject is a fullstack project utilizing a database with web interface for basic CRUD operations.
### Description
  My JPACRUDProject contains a mock database table relating to the healthcare
  industry.  The table has demographic data pertaining to a patient database.  My project database is called Perfect Health and also contains typical Protected Health Information (PHI) i.e., Social Security Number (SSN), Date of Birth, and Full Name.  The application gives the healthcare professional the option to view all patients located in the database, add new patients, edit an existing patient record, and delete a patient from the database.
  The web forms pre-populate fields with format data.  A confirmation page is displayed after add and delete actions.  Edit actions redirect the user to the show page which displays all patient data in the database including the previous edits.
### Technology
  The technologies used include Spring Tool Suite 4, MySQL Workbench, Zoom, Slack, JPA, and Springboot Project.  JSP files, CSS Styling Sheets, and BootStrap.
### Lessons Learned
This project was both fun to complete, and challenging.  The JSP files enabled me to apply select bootstrap styling to my project.  I designed an application icon on LogoKit for iOS.  The most challenging aspects of this project included mapping database entity, and performing delete, add, and update functions on the database.  The Update method in my controller / corresponding update JSP was the most problematic for me to get up and running.  With the assistance of fellow students and instructors, I was able to work through my errors and finish with a fully functional project that enables basic CRUD operations.
